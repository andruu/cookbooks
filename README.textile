h1. CakePHP cookbooks

Setup a CakePHP/Lithium instance. Yes, YMMV. Eventually this will be a CakePHP/CI/Kohana/Lithium/Zend cookbook set, but for now it is just CakePHP/Lithium

h2. Usage

I'll get to that.

h2. Copyrights?

This is an experiment in setting up a CakePHP/Lithium instance using Chef. All cookbooks are copyright (?) their appropriate creators, mostly Opscode and some SeatGeek action. I just didn't want to be yet another forker...

YMMV.

h2. Todo

- Fix MySQL Server so it doesn't constantly try to reinstall itself.
